## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Composite action over Docker: faster startup, uses existing native binaries from releases
- Separate repo (chuckd-action): independent version tags, clean marketplace publishing
- Fail check only (no PR comments): keep v1 simple, log output sufficient
- User-configured paths (no auto-detect): more predictable, works with any repo structure

### Key Implementation Notes

- CLI-01/CLI-02 are changes to chuckd binary in THIS repo; all other phases are in anentropic/chuckd-action
- chuckd currently returns issues.size() as exit code — must normalize to 0/1 (false-pass risk with 256+ issues)
- Platform name mapping required: GHA uses X64/ARM64, artifacts use x86_64/aarch64
- git-compare mode requires fetch-depth: 0 in caller's checkout step; add shallow-clone detection
- actions/checkout version: existing workflows use @v6 — verify canonical version before writing action.yml
- macOS Gatekeeper may require xattr -d com.apple.quarantine; scope v1 Linux-only for safety

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
