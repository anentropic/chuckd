> A schema evolutions validator.

Borrowed from [Confluent Schema Registry](https://github.com/confluentinc/schema-registry) and re-wrapped as a cli tool, so it supports JSON Schema, Avro and Protobuf formats.

Developed and tested against JDK 11 (AdoptOpenJDK as recommended [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/sample_building_java_applications.html#what_youll_need))
